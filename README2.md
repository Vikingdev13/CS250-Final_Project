## DIVING INTO DATA STRUCTURES IN C!

## Description

This is my final project for CSC250 - Computer Science II. I have decided to create a learning program that will help those looking to learn the basics about data strucutres in C, as well as help me reinforce what I have learned during the semester. There are no special tasks in order to run the program, simply compile and follow the menu options. There is a input.txt file included for use by some of the sorting programs.

## 6 Topics To Be Graded On

- 2D Arrays
- Structures
- Linked Lists(pointers)
- Sorting
- Recursion
- Stack/Queue

## Main Menu Options

The main menu contains the title, and the main menu options which are:
1 - Arrays: Overview of 1D and 2D Arrays with discriptions and examples in code.
2 - Linked Lists: Overview of Singly and Doubly Linked lists with code examples.
3 - Sorting: Overview of a few of the most common sorting algorithms as well as examples of each.
4 - Recursion: Overview of recursion with an example of recursion.
5 - Stacks: Overview of Stacks with examples in code.
6 - Queues: Overview of Queues with examples in code.
7 - Quit program.
